# MPC-TLS SDK

Welcome to the Primus MPC-TLS SDK! You can use [SDK](https://github.com/primus-labs/mpctls-js-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file) to directly implement **a data verification solution** in dApps without requiring backend cryptography or attestation workflow development.

## Quick Start for Beginners
New to Primus? Here's how to get started:

- 1.[Installation](../install/install_en.md) Get the SDK set up in your project.

- [The basic workflows](./work-flow/work-flow_en.md)


## Application Examples

- Verifying the number of followers on a user’s X account to determine if they are a KOL or a newcomer.
- Enabling assets verification using the user’s off-chain exchange asset, transaction volume, or token status.
- Verifying the ownership of a user’s social media account, such as TikTok or X, to provide basic PoH capability.
- And many more based on your needs...
